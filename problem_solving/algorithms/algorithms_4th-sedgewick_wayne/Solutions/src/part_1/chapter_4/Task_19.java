 * Task 1.4.19 (Local minimum of a matrix).
 * 
 * Given an N-by-N array a[] of N^2 distinct integers, design an algorithm that finds
 * a _local minimum_: an entry a[i][j] that is strictly less than its neighbors. Internal entries
 * have 4 neighbors; entries on an edge have 3 neighbors; entries on the corner have 2 neighbors.
 * The running time of your program should be proportional to N in the worst case, which means you
 * can't afford to examine all N^2 entries.
