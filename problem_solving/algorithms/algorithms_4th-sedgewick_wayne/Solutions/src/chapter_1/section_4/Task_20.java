 * 1.4.20 (Bitonic search).
 * 
 * An array is _bitonic_ if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed
 * immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array
 * of N distinct int values, determines whether a given integer is in the array. Your program should
 * use ~3 lg N compares in the worst case.
 * Extra credit: use only ~ 2 lg N compares in the worst case.
