/*
 * Exercise 4.3, p.138.
 *
 * Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined
 * to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents
 * a trade-off betwee efficient code generation and ponetial pitfalls in the use
 * of the laguage by the programmer.
 * Do you consider that an acceptable trade-offf? Why or why not?
 */

/* Answer.
 *
 * I consider the trade-off as acceptable, since C++ is a performance
 * oriented language. Besides the trage-off, it has other places that
 * sacrifice clarity/convinience for performance ever more.
